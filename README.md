# Learning

The learning project aims to test Redux and API integration skills using the Pokédex API in a Next.js application. The project involves setting up a Next.js project, installing Redux for state management, and creating a Redux store. The Pokédex API is used to fetch Pokémon data, which is then dispatched to Redux actions and stored in the application's state. React components are created to display the Pokémon data, and a search feature is implemented to allow users to search for specific Pokémon. The project also focuses on enhancing the user interface, handling errors and loading states, testing and debugging the application, and finally deploying the Next.js app to a hosting platform. This project provides practical experience in utilizing Redux, integrating with external APIs, and developing a real-world application using Next.js.
